# Portfolio

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

My goal & motivation is to build a portfolio page with deployed projects as the course progresses. This page is able to resize  and be viewed on various screens and devices. I learned how to utilize CSS, HTML as well as Javascript in the deployment of this project.
